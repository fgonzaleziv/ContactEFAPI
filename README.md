# ContactEFAPI

This is an EF Core based API; using migrations to create a database from Models.

This API is based off the concept of a contact management for the primary and secondary contacts for a department.

Each location can have multiple departments, each with the option to set a primary and secondary contact.

This is the start of a series of project based on this business case (Managing contacts for a department)

## Future ideas / expansion:

- Reverse engineering in EF core from a messy DB
- Cosmos DB instead of SQL Server
- graphQL 
- gRPC instead of REST
- ARM / bicep templates for easier deployment to azure
